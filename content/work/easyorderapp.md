role: Freelance Product Designer and Front-end Developer
description: 'EasyOrderApp is a business that create ordering app for restaurant'
mission: "As a freelancer, I had the opportunity to participate in the complete redesign of the food ordering application interface for a growing company. My role was to understand the user's needs and the current pain points of the existing interface, and then design an improved user experience to facilitate online food orders.<br />
<br />
I worked closely with the development team to implement my design in the application, ensuring that the interface was easy to use, fast, and aesthetically pleasing. Thanks to my product design and front-end development skills, I was able to offer my clients a complete solution, combining design and functionality."
