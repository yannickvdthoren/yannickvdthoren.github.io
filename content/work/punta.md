description: 'Punta is the ultimate social community to enhance your nomadic lifestyle'
mission: "As a Product Designer at Punta, I contributed to an innovative startup by redesigning the chat application for digital nomads. My goal was to give the application a professional and modern look that would meet the needs of our target audience.<br/>
<br/>
I worked closely with the development team to understand user needs, functional requirements, and technical challenges of the application. I then used my skills in user interface design to create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface while maintaining a high level of visual quality."
