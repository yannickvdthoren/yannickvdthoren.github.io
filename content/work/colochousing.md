role: UI/UX Designer and Full-Stack developer
description: Coloc Housing manage shared house in Belgium
mission: 'Folks use our website to search and apply for a shared house in Belgium. The roommates can then vote for the applicants and, if they are accepted, they can come and live in the house.
<br />
<br />I led the redesign of the dashboard for the owners and worked closely with the houses managing team for this. I also collaborated with a freelance developper who was in charge of integrating a new chat function. I made UI design based on the feedback from the users.
<br />
<br />Besides that, I was also in charge of coding the new dashboard and setting up the roadmap and the strategy for the new website : Functionalities, the technology to use, etcâ€¦'
