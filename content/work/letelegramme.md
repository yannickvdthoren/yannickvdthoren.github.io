mission: "During my time at Le Télégramme I had the opportunity to work on a lot of projects. My main mission was to design and integrating my design in the website.
<br />
<br />Collaborating with a UX agency, I participated in the interviews of users for the new website. On the basis of the UX analysis I then designed new screens, sections and categories for the website. 
<br />
<br />In collaboration with the engineering team we launched different web apps: <a href='https://randonnee.letelegramme.fr/'>Les Randonnées du Télégramme</a>, Les Festivals de l'été and <a href='https://plages.letelegramme.fr'>Tous à la plage</a>.
<br />
<br />During my stay there I also had the opportunity to work with the marketing team on a simplified e-shop and user account design."
