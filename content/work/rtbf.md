description: 'RTBF is a belgian media'
mission: "As a Full-Stack developer, I had the opportunity to work for RTBF on a key project to create an administration for video recording on the different RTBF servers. My role was to design and develop an efficient solution to manage the videos and associated metadata.<br />
<br />
I used Vue.js, Node.js, and an MSSQL server to create a performant and scalable solution. I worked closely with the development team to ensure that the application meets the company's needs and adheres to RTBF's high quality standards.<br />
<br />
The end result was a reliable and efficient solution that allowed RTBF to effectively manage videos and associated metadata. This led to a significant improvement in the quality and productivity of the company."
