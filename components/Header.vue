    <p>
      Iâ€™m a passionate <strong>UX/UI Designer</strong> and
      <strong>Front-end Developper</strong> (working to become a fullstack). I
      mainly worked with companies that were doing a total redesign of their
      website and needed help redoing the architecture of the whole app or just
      the style parts.
